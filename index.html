            <h2>About</h2>
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>
                    I research what happens when emerging technologies land in the real world. My current focus is on artificial intelligence, where I study the friction, negotiation, and adaptation that occur when AI meets existing institutions, organizations, and people. My work sits at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), and Technology Policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research is organized in three interconnected layers. At the <strong>macro level</strong>, I study pragmatic and flexible technology governance: how countries design and adapt policy frameworks for technologies they are still learning about, how governance models travel (or fail to travel) across contexts, and how experimental approaches like regulatory sandboxes can support evidence-based regulation. At the <strong>meso level</strong>, I focus on participatory and sustainable digital transformation: how organizations, design teams, and public institutions can meaningfully involve citizens and stakeholders in shaping technology, and how AI tools can support collaborative processes without flattening the voices they aim to include. At the <strong>micro level</strong>, I investigate responsible and reflective human-AI interaction: how individuals actually use AI in professional practice, what this reveals about the distance between technological promise and everyday reality, and how we can design these interactions more thoughtfully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My research is grounded in practice. Before my PhD, I worked in Chile's Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Science, where I coordinated the development of the National AI Policy. Since then, I have worked on AI governance and technology policy with governments and international organizations, such as UNESCO and the Inter-American Development Bank, across Latin America, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia. I bring this experience into my research: I study technology governance informed by the realities of how policy is actually made and implemented in the Global South.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a Ph.D. candidate in Information Science at Cornell University, advised by Cristobal Cheyre, with committee members Qian Yang and Malte Ziewitz.
